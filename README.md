# employeeDetails
a dummy spring-boot application that lets the user manipulate a data-base via REST end-points

## Workings

* the user would then invoke the REST end-point getEmployeeById (http://localhost:8081//EmployeeDetails/v1/getEmployeeById)
* the JSON in the src/main/resources/input path can be used as an input
* the full list of employees can be viewed at the h2-console (http://localhost:8081/h2-console)
